  <h1>Limits in Calculus</h1>

  <p>Limits are a fundamental concept in calculus that describe the behavior of a function as its input approaches a certain   
 value.</p>

  <h2>Informal Definition</h2>
  <p>Informally, the limit of a function f(x) as x approaches a is the value that f(x) approaches as x gets closer and closer to a, but never   
 equals a.</p>

  <h2>Formal Definition</h2>
  <p>Formally, the limit of f(x) as x approaches a is denoted as:</p>
  <pre>
  lim f(x) = L
  x→a
  </pre>
  <p>This means that for any ε > 0, there exists a δ > 0 such that if 0 < |x - a| < δ, then |f(x) - L| < ε.</p>

  <h2>Examples</h2>
  <p>Here are some examples of limits:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>lim x = a</li>
    <li>lim x^2 = a^2</li>
    <li>lim 1/x = ∞ (as x approaches 0 from the right)</li>
    <li>lim sin(x)/x = 1</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Properties of Limits</h2>
  <p>Limits have several properties, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Sum rule: lim (f(x) + g(x)) = lim f(x) + lim g(x)</li>
    <li>Difference rule: lim (f(x) - g(x)) = lim f(x) - lim g(x)</li>
    <li>Product rule: lim (f(x) * g(x)) = lim f(x) * lim g(x)</li>
    <li>Quotient rule: lim (f(x) / g(x)) = lim f(x) / lim g(x), provided lim g(x) ≠ 0</li>
    <li>Power rule: lim (f(x))^n = (lim f(x))^n</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Applications of Limits</h2>
  <p>Limits are used in many areas of mathematics and science, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Calculus: Derivatives and integrals are defined using limits.</li>
    <li>Physics: Limits are used to calculate velocity, acceleration, and other physical quantities.</li>
    <li>Economics: Limits are used to analyze market behavior and economic growth.</li>
    <li>Engineering: Limits are used to design structures and systems.</li>
  </ul>
